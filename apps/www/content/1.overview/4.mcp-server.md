The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that allows AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and other AI-powered tools to securely connect with external data sources and systems. Think of it as a "universal remote" that lets your AI tools access real-world data and functionality.

AI Elements Vue supports MCP to supercharge your AI development workflow.

## Installation Guide

::steps
  ### Step 1: Choose Your AI Tool

  First, make sure you're using an AI development tool that supports MCP:

  - [Claude Desktop](https://claude.com/download) (Free - recommended for beginners)
  - [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) (AI coding assistant)
  - [Cursor](https://cursor.com) (AI-powered code editor)
  - [Windsurf by Codeium](https://windsurf.com) (AI development platform)
  - Other MCP-compatible tools

  ### Step 2: Locate Your Configuration File

  Depending on your AI tool, you'll need to edit one of these files:

  - **Claude Desktop**: `Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
  - **Claude Code**: `.claude.json`
  - **Cursor** `.cursor/mcp.json`
  - **Windsurf**: `.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`
  - **Other tools**: Check your tool's MCP documentation

  ### Step 3: Add AI Elements Vue Configuration

  #### Option A: Manual Configuration (All Tools)

  Copy and paste this configuration into your MCP config file:

  ```json [.cursor/mcp.json]
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "ai-elements-vue": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
          "-y",
          "mcp-remote",
          "https://registry.ai-elements-vue.com/mcp"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  #### Option B: Quick Install (Claude Code Only)

  If you're using Claude Code, you can use the built-in command:

  ```bash
  claude mcp add --transport http ai-elements-vue https://registry.ai-elements-vue.com/mcp
  ```

  This automatically adds the server to your .claude.json configuration.

  ### Step 4: Restart Your AI Tool

  Close and reopen your AI application for the changes to take effect.

  ### Step 5: Verify the Connection

  Test the integration by asking your AI assistant:

  > **"What AI Elements Vue components are available for building an AI app?"**

  If successful, your AI should be able to list and explain AI Elements Vue components!

## Multiple MCP Servers

You can use AI Elements Vue alongside other MCP servers:

```json [.cursor/mcp.json]
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-elements-vue": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://registry.ai-elements-vue.com/mcp"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/project"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Getting Component Information

Ask your AI assistant:

> **"Show me how to use the AI Elements Vue PromptInput component with different variants"**

Expected response will include current documentation and code examples.

### Building Layouts

> **"Help me create an AI app layout using AI Elements Vue components"**

Your AI can suggest appropriate layout components and provide implementation code.

### Styling Guidance

> **"What are the recommended spacing tokens in AI Elements Vue?"**

Get up-to-date information about design tokens and styling conventions.
